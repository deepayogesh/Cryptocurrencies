# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.
Report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Summary 
The data I was working with was not ideal, so it was processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output I decided to use unsupervised learning. 
To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on a clustering algorithm. 
Used 3-D and 2-D  data visualizations to share my findings.

- Worked on Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions to 2 Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means algorithm
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results in 3-D model and 2-D model.
